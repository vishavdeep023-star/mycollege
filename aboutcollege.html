    <p><strong>The most noticeable difference between school and college is the shift towards independence. Unlike the structured, protected environment of school, college life is marked by flexibility and self-management. Suddenly, students are in charge of their own schedules, finances, and day-to-day decisions. This newfound freedom is exhilarating but also comes with the challenge of learning to balance academic commitments, social life, and personal responsibilities. Developing effective time management, budgeting, and self-discipline are crucial skills that are honed during this period, preparing students for the complexities of the real world.</strong></p>
